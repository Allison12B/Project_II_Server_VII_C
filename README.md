# Project 2 - Second project with APIs
This project was developed with Express.js.

## Install

- npm install

## Run

- npm start

## Test

- To test this you can use [postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a simple curl request: `curl http://localhost:3001/hello`

This repository is responsible for making all requests through the controllers calling the necessary database models.
In this case, a NoSQL database (MongoDB) is being used.
