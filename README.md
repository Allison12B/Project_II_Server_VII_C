# Project 2 - Second project with APIs
This project was developed with Express.js.It allows the frontend to make requests to the REST 
API to access general CRUD actions (create, delete, and update information).

It also allows you to use the YouTube API to search and retrieve information for each video that the usar want.

Also you can only consume this API with the frontend assigned to this project (Project_II_Client_VII_C), 
because you need to have a web token that allows you to validate that the user is registered.

## Install
